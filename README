The slate has been wiped clean. It's time to restart Silicon Valley. Future founders, come and meet your peers to plot out the future. 

This Reboot takes place at my home in Los Altos on March 24th (Friday) from 5-8.
If you'd like to join, please make a pull request and I'll include the address in the comments. Pizza and drinks will be included.
